## Initializing a Repository

git init =  creates a new repository; git commands are not available outside of an initialized repository
git status = finding files you have listed or committed in repository

** good to keep commits small in stages
because of this git creates a 'staging area'
between the working directory (where files are located on computer)
and the repository

git add = adds file (any files following command) to the staging area before commit

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
- It's a nice in-between zone that lets you experiment and make changes until it is ready
to be committed to your repository
