# You can become a better program with version control by more collaboration

# The pros and cons of manual commits is freedom of saving and inconsistency
# between teams when they commit

# 'git diff' + 2 ids will show line comparison
# of what code has changed

# Reflect using git to view history

## git log = shows path of changes in file
## git diff first_file second_file = compares files and changes in its history
## first_file is below second_file from git log

# Reflect using git to revert history

## git checkout == reverts version of code
